## üìù Additional Notes on Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The project adheres to a standard **Clean Architecture** approach using **MVVM** across three distinct layers:

* **Presentation Layer:** Contains UI elements (Activities, Fragments) and **ViewModels** which manage UI state.
* **Domain Layer:** Holds the core **Use Cases** (business logic) and defines the **Repository Interfaces**.
* **Data Layer:** Contains **Data Sources** and the **Repository Implementation** which fetches, stores, and maps data according to the Domain interfaces.

### Key Implementation Details

| Feature | Technology Used | Implementation Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Asynchronicity** | **Kotlin Coroutines** | Used throughout the Data and Domain layers for thread management and non-blocking operations. |
| **Data Management** | **Repository Pattern** | The Data layer implements a clean **Repository** to abstract data fetching from its source (e.g., local storage or network). |
| **Dependency Injection** | **Hilt** | Used to manage and provide dependencies (like Repositories and Use Cases) across all layers, ensuring loose coupling. |
| **Language** | **Kotlin** | The entire codebase is primarily written in Kotlin. |
